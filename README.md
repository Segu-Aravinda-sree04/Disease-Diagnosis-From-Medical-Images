# Disease-Diagnosis-From-Medical-Images
A deep learning-based system for automatic disease diagnosis from medical images such as histopathological images. This project uses (CNNs) and state-of-the-art transfer learning models (e.g., ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) to detect abnormalities and classify disease types with high accuracy.
